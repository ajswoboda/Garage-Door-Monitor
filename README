This is an experimental python program that provides an update when the garage door changes state. This runs on a Raspberry Pi and requires the oauth libraries to connect to gmail.


Event Notifications Occur
1. When the garage door opens
2. If the garage door remains open for a period of time
3. When the garage door closes. 

This will send a picture on event notifications 1 and 2.

This will also allow an email with the right phrase to close the garage door.

It should be noted that most of this is experimental and only has been tested on my garage door.
